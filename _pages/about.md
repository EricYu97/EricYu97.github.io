This is Weikang Yu's academic page on the web!

I am a PhD researcher at the Helmholtz Institute Freiberg (HIF) for Resource Technology, Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf, Germany. I'm a part of the machine learning group at HIF. I earned my M.Phil and B.E. degrees from the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen, and Beihang University, respectively. My PhD supervisor is Prof. Pedram Ghamisi.  

My research focuses on developing cutting edge deep learning models for remote sensing (RS) applications, as parts of the Artificial Intelligence for Remote Sensing (AI4RS) studies. In particular, I'm interested in the studies of change detection, unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA), and image enhancement.

* Change Detection
* Federated Learning
* Cloud Removal
* Multi-Target Domain Adaptation (MTDA)
* Text-to-Image Generation
* Weakly-Supervised Learning
* Transformer Models
* Diffusion Models
