This is Weikang Yu's academic page on the web!

I am a PhD researcher at the Helmholtz Institute Freiberg (HIF) for Resource Technology, Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf, Germany. I'm a part of the machine learning group at HIF. I earned my M.Phil and B.E. degrees from the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen, and Beihang University, respectively. My PhD supervisor is Prof. Pedram Ghamisi.

My research focuses on developing cutting edge deep learning models for remote sensing applications, as parts of the Artificial Intelligence for Remote Sensing (AI4RS) studies. In particular, I'm interested in the studies of change detection, unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA), and image enhancement.

My previous research experience includes:
* AI Security in Remote Sensing
* Deformable Self-Attention-based Models for Change Detection
* Federated Learning in Remote Sensing
* Image Enhancement in Remote Sensing (Cloud Removal)
* Multi-Target Domain Adaptation (MTDA) for Change Detection
* Text-to-Image Generation in Remote Sensing
* Weakly-Supervised Learning
* Transformer Models
* Diffusion Models
