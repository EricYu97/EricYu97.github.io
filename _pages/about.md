I am a PhD researcher at the Helmholtz Institute Freiberg (HIF) for Resource Technology, Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf (HZDR), Germany. I am also with the Chair of Data Science in Earth Observation, Technical University of Munich (TUM), Germany. I'm a part of the machine learning group at HIF. I earned my M.Phil and B.E. degrees from the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen, and Beihang University, respectively. My PhD supervisor is Prof. Pedram Ghamisi and Prof. Xiaoxiang Zhu.  

My research focuses on developing cutting edge deep learning models for remote sensing (RS) applications, as parts of the Artificial Intelligence for Remote Sensing (AI4RS) studies. In particular, I'm interested in the studies of change detection, unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA), and responsible AI.  


My research experience and interests include Remote Sensing and Deep Learning especially:
* AI Security in RS
* Change Detection
* Responsible AI
* Multi-Target Domain Adaptation (MTDA)
* Weakly-Supervised Learning
* Foundation Models
* Mining Industries
